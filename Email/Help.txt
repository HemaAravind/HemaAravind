Configuration:

A consent has to be provided by the user inorder to access the mail in the default browser opened by the script .
Select the email ID's mentioned above in the browser opened
Click continue on the consecutive screens so that the required consent is provided for the respective Email ID's


Data:
There are two fields provided in the inputdatasheet,
CredentialFile  - Name of the credential file that was generated for each of the mail id's are provided here . They are present in the src/main/java/resources folder
Subject - Provide the subject of the mail that has to be verified in each of the mail id's. 


Step1 needs to done manually as we delete the StoredCredentials file that will be generated after accessing the mailID once . This is done to avoid the mailID in 
second iteration referencing the 'Stored Credentials' generated for the mail ID in first iteration

If only one mailID is used and the 'Stored Credentials' file is not deleted , then Step1 is an one time configuration . Then the execution will be done without asking for this
configuration .
